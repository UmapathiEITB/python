# Python Number

# There are 3 numberic types in python int, float, complex

# int

x = 5
x = -5
print(type(x))

# float float will cover with float point with one or two decimal and numbers with e to indicate

x = 1.10
x = -1.10
print(type(x))

# Complex are number written with j

x = 1j
print(type(x))


# Type Conversion

x = 1
y = 2.8
z = 1j

a = float(x)
b = int(y)
c = complex(1)

print(c)

# Random Number

import random

print(random.randrange(1,10))
